This project is focused on building and coding a robotic arm to imitate the natural structure of a human arm.




The combination of a wrist and a hand will include 12 degrees of freedom
 - 1 DOF for each finger for a combination of 4 DOF.
 - 3 DOF for thumb.
 - 6 DOF total for fingers + thumb.
 - 0 DOF for locking joints
 - 1 DOF for spread
 - 4 DOF for wrist movements

 - Total of 12 DOF servo bank contains 12 limited angular servos
